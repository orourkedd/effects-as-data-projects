const { handlers } = require('effects-as-data/node')

//  effects-as-data has several built-in actions/handlers making
//  it easy to perform and test complex, side effect producing operations:
//  @see https://github.com/orourkedd/effects-as-data#actions-packaged-with-effects-as-data

//  You can add your own handlers here by
//  merging them into the handlers object.  Handlers
//  receive actions (@see /actions) and perform side
//  effects described by those actions.
